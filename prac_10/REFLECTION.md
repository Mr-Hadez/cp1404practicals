# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Typically, my estimations were reasonable, but with some of the larger programs I tended to underestimate the time it would take.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I'd like to imagine I got more accurate with my estimations over the course of the subject, but I think it realistically stayed relatively the same.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that I am a methodical thinker so it can take me a while to do each section of a program before moving on to the next.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learnt that my code is usually pretty good, but sometimes I need more specific variable names and I need to make sure my program matches the output exactly.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learnt that it is very easy to make silly mistakes when coding, like missing a docstring or even missing a requirement of the task because you really need
to thoroughly read over the instructions so you don't miss anything.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 06 Code Review](https://github.com/Z-MALT001/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-15239772292)

### Explanation

This was a good code review because I picked up on little things like missing docstrings and redundant usage of brackets, as well as some logic errors. 
I ensured all my feedback was conveyed in a kind and respectful manner, with the comments phrased like suggestions (e.g. "Perhaps you could...").

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 07 Code Review](https://github.com/ewabuczkowska/cp1404practicals/pull/4#event-15320432590)

### Explanation

I think this code review was good as well because I incorporated some of the feedback in my assignment to make insightful comments. I suggested using constants
for magic numbers, pointed out a potential error, highlighted the use of code that hasn't been taught in this subject and recommended using more functions to
reduce low-level detail in main. Again, I ensured all comments were phrased in a nice and constructive manner.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Maybe I would include more paper coding to prepare students for the exam. Otherwise, the subject is well-structured.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I really did put maximum effort into the practicals and I genuinely wanted to use them as a learning opportunity to get better at coding. I also tried to give people
good code reviews that would help them with their learning.

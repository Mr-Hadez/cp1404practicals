I am actively learning and refining my coding ability, and I try to find an efficient solution to each problem. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I could practice more outside of class time.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Not putting docstrings in each function.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am reading through all the instructions and giving my best go at completing the task. If I need any help I will ask one of my mates or Lindsay. Afterwards, I look at the solutions so I can see where I could improve in my code.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started to use the python console to test out more code and understand it in my own time.

Due to engineering final exams coming up I have been prioritising other subjects more, but I could still allocate more time to programming.

I have been trying my best to not just get the code to work but also to be more efficient and have the right naming conventions as much as possible. 
I think my prac work reflects this.

I still have to try and practice writing code on paper more.
